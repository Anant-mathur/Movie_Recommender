# Movies Recommender System


In this notebook, I will attempt at implementing a few recommendation algorithms (content based, popularity based and collaborative filtering) and try to build an ensemble of these models to come up with our final recommendation system. With us, we have two MovieLens datasets.

* **The Movies Dataset:** A dataset of 4814 rows containing columns such as budget, genres etc.
* **The Credits Dataset:** A dataset of 4814 rows containing columns such as movie_id, title, cast, crew
